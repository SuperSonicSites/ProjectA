# RSS Feed Guide - Automatic Publication to Pinterest

## How It Works Right Now ✅

Every file in `content/animals/cats/` is automatically included in the RSS feed at:

**Feed URL**: `https://paperpause.app/animals/cats/index.xml`

Hugo automatically:
1. ✅ Detects all markdown files in the cats directory
2. ✅ Generates an RSS feed with proper XML structure
3. ✅ Includes images in `<media:content>` tags (1000x1500px for Pinterest)
4. ✅ Links back to your claimed domain

---

## Important: Draft vs. Published

### Current State
All your generated cat posts have `draft: true`:

```yaml
---
title: "Cat Coloring Page: Gardener Cat watering a"
draft: true  # ❌ NOT in RSS feed
---
```

### What This Means

**Hugo's behavior**:
- `draft: true` → **Hidden** from RSS feed, search engines, and Pinterest
- `draft: false` → **Published** in RSS feed, visible to everyone

### Why Drafts Exist

The generation workflow creates drafts so you can:
1. Generate content
2. Review/approve in dashboard (`npm run dashboard`)
3. Manually publish or approve good ones
4. Reject/delete bad ones

---

## Making Content Appear in RSS Feed

### Option 1: Approve via Dashboard (Recommended)

```bash
npm run dashboard
```

In the dashboard:
- Click **"Approve ✅"** button
- This automatically sets `draft: false`
- Content now appears in RSS feed

### Option 2: Manually Edit Frontmatter

Edit the `.md` file and change:

```yaml
draft: true  # Change this to false
```

to:

```yaml
draft: false  # Now published
```

### Option 3: Bulk Publish Script

For publishing multiple files at once, I can create a script.

## Current Files Status

Looking at your cats folder:

| File | Status | In RSS Feed? |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `cat-1765764823831-0.md` | `draft: true` | ❌ No |
| `cat-1765764843714-1.md` | `draft: true` | ❌ No |
| `cat-1765764863947-2.md` | `draft: true` | ❌ No |
| `cat-1765764885200-3.md` | `draft: true` | ❌ No |
| `cat-1765764909971-4.md` | `draft: true` | ❌ No |
| `cat-01.md` | No draft field | ✅ Yes (default published) |

**Result**: Only `cat-01.md` is currently in the RSS feed.

## How to Publish All Current Cat Posts

### Quick Method: Update Each File

For each file, change line 6 from:
```yaml
draft: true
```

to:
```yaml
draft: false
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
npm run build
```

The RSS feed at `/animals/cats/index.xml` will now include all 5 cat posts.

---

## RSS Feed Content Structure

When a post is published (`draft: false`), it appears in RSS as:

```xml
<item>
  <title>Cat Coloring Page: Gardener Cat watering a</title>
  <link>https://paperpause.app/animals/cats/gardener-cat/</link>
  <pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2024 02:13:58 -0700</pubDate>
  <description>A beautiful cat coloring page generated by AI...</description>
  
  <!-- Pinterest will use this image (1000x1500px) -->
  <enclosure url="https://...r2.cloudflarestorage.com/cats/cat-123.png" />
  <media:content 
    url="https://...r2.cloudflarestorage.com/cats/cat-123.png" 
    width="1000" 
    height="1500" 
  />
</item>
```

Pinterest reads this and automatically creates a Pin with:
- **Image**: 1000x1500px from `<media:content>`
- **Title**: From `<title>`
- **Description**: From `<description>`
- **Link**: From `<link>` (drives traffic back to your site)

---

## Workflow for Future Posts

### Normal Workflow

1. **Generate**: `npm run generate 10`
   - Creates 10 drafts with `draft: true`

2. **Review**: `npm run dashboard`
   - View all generated images
   - Click "Approve ✅" for good ones (sets `draft: false`)
   - Click "Reject ❌" for bad ones (deletes file)

3. **Build**: `npm run build`
   - Rebuilds site
   - Regenerates RSS feed with approved posts

4. **Deploy**: Push to Cloudflare Pages
   - RSS feed updates automatically
   - Pinterest fetches new content within 24 hours

### Auto-Publish Workflow (No Review)

If you trust the AI generation and want to auto-publish:

Modify `scripts/morning-routine/tasks/generate-batch.ts` line 37:

```typescript
// Change this line:
draft: true

// To this:
draft: false
```

Then all generated posts will immediately appear in RSS feed (no approval needed).

## Verifying RSS Feed Content

### Test Locally

After building:
```bash
npm run build
```

Check the RSS file:
```bash
# On Windows PowerShell:
Get-Content public/animals/cats/index.xml | Select-String "item"

# Or open in browser:
http://localhost:1313/animals/cats/index.xml
```

### Test in Production

After deploying:
```
https://paperpause.app/animals/cats/index.xml
```

You should see:
- ✅ All published posts (where `draft: false`)
- ✅ Images in `<media:content>` tags
- ✅ Correct dimensions (1000x1500)
- ✅ Links to your domain

### Test with RSS Reader

Use any RSS reader (Feedly, Inoreader, etc.):
1. Subscribe to: `https://paperpause.app/animals/cats/index.xml`
2. Verify posts and images appear
3. Confirms feed is working before connecting to Pinterest

---

## Pinterest Connection Steps

Once you have published posts in RSS:

1. **Claim Website**:
   - Log in to Pinterest Business
   - Settings → Claimed Accounts → Add `paperpause.app`

2. **Connect RSS Feed**:
   - Settings → Create Pins in bulk → Auto-publish
   - Add feed: `https://paperpause.app/animals/cats/index.xml`
   - Select board: "Cat Coloring Pages"
   - Save

3. **Wait 24 Hours**:
   - Pinterest checks feed daily
   - Automatically creates Pins from new items
   - Up to 200 Pins per day

4. **Monitor**:
   - Pinterest Analytics → Filter by RSS feed
   - Track impressions, saves, clicks

## Troubleshooting

### "No items in RSS feed"

**Cause**: All posts have `draft: true`  
**Fix**: Approve posts in dashboard or set `draft: false`

### "Pinterest says feed is empty"

**Cause**: RSS feed not updated after publishing  
**Fix**: Run `npm run build` and redeploy

### "Images not showing in RSS reader"

**Cause**: Image URLs might be incorrect or CF Images not configured  
**Fix**: Check that R2 image URLs are publicly accessible

### "Pinterest says links don't match claimed domain"

**Cause**: Links point to wrong domain  
**Fix**: Verify `baseURL` in `hugo.toml` is `https://paperpause.app/`
