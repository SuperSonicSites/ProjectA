# 1.D.2 — Immunization (negative_prompt only, 500 char cap)

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Reduce recurring QA failures by applying bounded, reversible immunizations to prompt configs.

## Non-negotiable safety constraints
- Agent 1 may only mutate `negative_prompt` (or `immunization_terms` merged into it).
- Total model input prompt (positive + negative + separators) must be **≤ 500 characters**.
- Evidence threshold before editing (e.g., ≥ 5 occurrences of same reason in 14 days).
- Bounded edits per week and per run (caps).
- Cooldown to avoid thrash.
- Every change is git-revertable and logged.
- **Model**: `gemini-3-flash-preview` (Thinking: **MEDIUM**).

## Acceptance criteria
- Immunization edits never cause prompt growth beyond 500 characters.
- Re-running immunization does not repeatedly append duplicate terms.
- A revert path exists for every change (single revert commit).
