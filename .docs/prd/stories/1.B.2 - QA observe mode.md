# 1.B.2 — QA observe mode

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Run QA on generated candidates and collect verdicts/reasons without rejecting or halting production.

## Behavior
- QA runs for each generated candidate.
- Results are logged (workflow summary + structured logs), but do not alter publishing/finishing.
- **Vision Requirement**: Ensure the agent is called with `MEDIA_RESOLUTION_ULTRA_HIGH`.

## Acceptance criteria
- When `QA_MODE=observe`, the pipeline output matches baseline (no rejections).
- QA metrics are visible per run/collection:
  - pass rate
  - top failure reasons (if any)

## Rollback
- Set `ENABLE_QA=0`.
